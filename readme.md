## TFE is my take on file explorers it works in a terminal
![](./assets/default.png)
# What I want to add in the future:
- editor inside file-explorer
- copy path
- search multiple folders
- smb
# Things I already added
- reading files
- deleting files
- modifying files (open editor)
- renaming files
- moving files
- clipboard
- icons
- copying files
- searching files
- previewing text files
- previewing folders
# Installation
### For now you need to clone the repository and run it yourself using
```bash
go run .
```
# Known bugs
- When searching explorer can crash
- When view isn't default searching breaks almost everything
- cursor value doesn't change while searching which can cause crashes 
- when previewing files contents of files merge in the preview

Yes I know that I'm bad at naming things
